          I found a love for me <br>
          Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead <br>
          I found a girl, beautiful and sweet  <br>

        <p>
          Cause we were just kids when we fell in love  <br>
          Not knowing what it was <br>
          I will not give you up this time <br>
          Darling, just kiss me slow <br>
          Your heart is all I own <br>
          And in your eyes, you're holding mine

        <h2>Refr√£o</h2>
        <p>
          Baby, I'm dancing in the dark <br>
          With you between my arms <br>
          Barefoot on the grass <br>
          Listening to our favorite song <br>
          When you said you looked a mess <br>
          I whispered underneath my breath <br>
          But you heard it <br>
          Darling, you look perfect tonight <br>
